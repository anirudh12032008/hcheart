# Connected Hearts

## Journal Title - Connected hearts
Heart shaped pcb with esp32 as the main heart, 15 RGB led, a buzzer, a display, buttons, 1or 2 3.7V cell . Basically I would need atleast 2 PCBs. The esp32 will be connected to cloud with the help of a external serer hosted on cloud and both of the esp will pull code from it frequently. It would act as a messaging device when one can enter there msg and it would be displayed on both of the PCB, which makes it cool.

## June 21:- ATTiny85 integration
I realised that this wouldn't be consider a good project as there is no such new things and such projects are already available., so to make it unique I started to work with attiny85 which could allow me to add more variations in colors and also help me create some logics. Also wrote the program for the attiny to work on and tested it on wokwi
