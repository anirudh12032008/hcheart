# Connected Hearts
Connected heart is a project which contains a 3d case and a pcb with esp32, 15rgb leds, buzzer, oled display, a few buttons and a battery with tp4056. The main objective of this project is to create a device which can be used by a group of friends or random people to connect with each other, the esp32 will be connected to a external server from which it will get the data to perform action like playing any sound or turning lights or displaying some messages. Everyone can send there msg on a web server which then be used to trigger these actions on the device. and also show the msg on every device making them connnected without a phone but just a Heart.

## why build connected Heart?
Im currently in high school and going to college next year, and I wanted to create something which can be used by my trio so that we can connect with each other even when not togethere and in the most cool way and also I can use this to impress someone special... And wait its easy to recreate also from the schematic so you can also make it and use it to connect with your friends or someone special.

### Why 3?
As the main objective of thisproject is to connect friends and people I need atleast 3 to implement this idea and actually make it useful. The PCB has min 5 and all other component make it less then $10 to create another. I hope you consider this ðŸ’–
