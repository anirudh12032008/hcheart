# Connected Hearts
Heart shaped pcb with esp32 as the main heart, 15 RGB led, a buzzer, a display, buttons, 1or 2 3.7V cell . Basically I would need atleast 2 PCBs. The esp32 will be connected to cloud with the help of a external serer hosted on cloud and both of the esp will pull code from it frequently. It would act as a messaging device when one can enter there msg and it would be displayed on both of the PCB, which makes it cool.
